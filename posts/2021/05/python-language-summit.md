Yesterday I had the privilege to give a talk about HPy at the
[Python Language Summit 2021](https://us.pycon.org/2021/summits/language/).

The organizers of the summit will soon publish a full report about the event,
but in the meantime you might be interested in the
[slides of the talk](/talks/2021/05/hpy-present-and-future.pdf).
