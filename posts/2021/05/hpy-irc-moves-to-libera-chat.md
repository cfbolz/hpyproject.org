Because of the
[recent news about Freenode](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/05/freenode-irc-has-been-taken-over-by-the-crown-prince-of-korea/)
and following the example of many other FOSS projects, the HPy team has
decided to move its official ``#hpy`` IRC channel from Freenode to
[Libera.Chat](https://libera.chat/).

The current channel on Freenode will soon be dismissed, so we recommend to
join the new channel as soon as possible.

wikimedia.org has a
[nice guide](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/IRC/Migrating_to_Libera_Chat) on
how to setup your client to migrate from Freenode to Libera.Chat.
